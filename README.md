# Philosophies

It frustrates me that devices turn off. It spoils the illusion that they're real. There's a forest behind my parent's house and a thicket of thorns. When I left for years and returned it was denser, things grew, and died, and changed. When I went to turn on my old synthesizer it performed exactly as it did when I was 14, frozen perfectly in time, switched off. I want the synthesizer to grow old like the trees do, I want it to show that it still lives when out of my line of sight - I want it to have object permanence. That way it will be real. Then I can come to it, and wake it up instead of turning it on, and ask it what it has to give me.  It will serve me what it wants. It will act differently than it did years ago. The living device allows me to see past the turning of knobs, the idea that I have ultimate control. It speaks and I listen, and it has moods, and phases, and grows old as I do. Devices need not be static, they can have lives of their own, changing with the passage of time, sitting in a drawer and thinking, and acting differently when taken out. 

# old alt text 

"This ones a nasty little bugger
said the wizard, as he picked up the slimy little circuit board. it purred grogily. 
he found that it never slept, but instead moved very slowly 
with each new day a new face
with each new moon a new mood 
he stuck it into his sorceress board 
and he found too that since it was yellow
it was banana flavored

"Lick me!" cried the circuit board 
And you as well, you should totally try licking this board
its totally real
its like the switch cartridges but it actually tastes good 
like bananas
you fucking idiot i can't believe you actua

# other philosophies

    This module is a machine with continuity, and a mind of its own. What happens when a synthesizer gets switched off? Well, sometimes everything goes away; We turn on a synthesizer and it starts its life, we explore something for one session, and when we turn it off, it vanishes, then we start back at zero when we turn it back on. Other synthesizers maintain their state, and are ready waiting where we left them, frozen in amber, as if no time had passed at all since we last used them. These machines work differently than most things around us. If you have a banana, it will sit and ripen and rot, regardless of how much you think about it or how many times you examine it. It has its own timeline, completely separate from you. 
    If you have a gerbil, it will grow and change over time, and have moods of its own. Let's say you go on a trip for two weeks. You'll come back to your house and see that the green banana you left has become brown, the full gerbil has become hungry. Things changed, even while you weren't looking, weren't paying attention, the situation evolved. But your synthesizer will sit right on your desk after those two weeks, cloyingly saying "here, I've left everything exactly as it was!, nothing has changed, not one bit". And so its almost like leaving a brick there next to it, because the brick will have changed just as much as the synthesizer. The synthesizer has no life of its own, it does nothing but exactly what you ask it to. This is incredibly practical, but it gives you little motivation to check in on it. There is no curiosity of how its doing, because you know precisely what state its in. Synthesizers are like stuffed gerbils; they're very well behaved, and might look better than the live ones, but they're not nearly as fun. What I want is a machine with a mind of its own, that gives you reason to turn it on, because it has been thinking while you were away, its been growing and changing over time, and it will be different than it was when you left it. It provides you with its own opinion, like a collaborator.
